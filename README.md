# SMART-Keycloak-eID
Secure access to electronic patient records through a standalone SMART on FHIR app that utilizes Keycloak and ID Austria for authorization and authentication. Note: This is a prototype implementation. The necessary FHIR server is simulated in this setup. ID Austria is temporarily replaced by GitHub as the external identity provider.
