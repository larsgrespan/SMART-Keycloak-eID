        <h1>Welcome to the Standalone SMART on FHIR App for Patients</h1>
        <p>
            This SMART on FHIR App is a prototype to integrate national electronic IDs 
            as authentication method. The objective is that patients can login to the 
            SMART on FHIR app using their existing governmental credentials and access 
            their electronic health record through it. For the national electronic ID 
            ID Austria has been used. Click on the log in button to try it out.
